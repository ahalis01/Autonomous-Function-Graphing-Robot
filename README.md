# Autonomous-Function-Graphing-Robot
This repository contains the code used to control a lego EV3 mechanical system. 

This system graphs sinusodial and polynomial functions on classroom sized whiteboards.

Wrote C++ methods using OOP design that ensures the robot moves in the preferred direction using PID control, re-calibrates and controls the mechanical systems by applying algorithms.
